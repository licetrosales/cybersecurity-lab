# Milestone 1: Network Scanning and Vulnerability Assessment

## 1. Overview

This milestone simulates a client-side vulnerability assessment commissioned by TechShield, a managed IT services provider, to identify and mitigate internal threats. The primary goal is to detect live hosts, enumerate services, and scan for vulnerabilities across a test lab environment.

### Virtual Machines (VMs)

| VM                  | Purpose                                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pentester**       | Kali Linux machine used for scanning and testing         |
| **Victim-Laptop**   | Host targeted during enumeration                         |
| **Application Server** | Runs DVWA and Mutillidae vulnerable apps             |
