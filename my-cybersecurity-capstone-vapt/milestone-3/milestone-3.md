# Milestone 3: Windows Password Attacks via EternalBlue Exploitation

## 1. Overview
This milestone focuses on exploiting a Windows 7 machine using the EternalBlue vulnerability (MS17-010), followed by credential harvesting, online and offline password cracking, and post-exploitation validation using SMB and RPC services. This exercise simulates realistic attack vectors and highlights the risks associated with weak password policies and credential reuse.
