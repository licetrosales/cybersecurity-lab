# Milestone 2: DVWA Web Exploitation 

## 1. Overview
This milestone demonstrates practical exploitation of common web application vulnerabilities using the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) in a controlled lab environment. Key attack vectors explored include:

- SQL Injection
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- PHP Webshell Uploads
- Reverse Shells via `msfvenom`

The DVWA security level was configured to Low to simulate real-world scenarios. Tools utilized during this milestone include Kali Linux, the Metasploit Framework, msfvenom, and a web browser for manual testing and validation.
