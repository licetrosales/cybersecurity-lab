# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Lab

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity learning lab!  
This repository tracks my hands-on practice in:

- ✅ Python scripting for ethical hacking
- ✅ Linux command-line and bash scripting
- ✅ Tool usage (Nmap, Wireshark)
- ✅ Notes and walkthroughs from cybersecurity platforms
- ✅ VAPT Capstone Project focused on vulnerability assessment and penetration testing
